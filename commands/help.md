description: Get help with EverMem plugin setup and available commands
---

EverMem is a memory plugin for Claude Code that automatically stores and retrieves relevant context from your past coding sessions.

**How it works:**
- When you chat with Claude, your conversations are automatically saved to EverMem Cloud
- When you start a new session, relevant memories from past sessions are automatically injected into context
- You can also manually search your memories using the `/evermem:search` command

First, check if the API key is configured:

```bash
if [ -z "${EVERMEM_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  echo "STATUS: Not configured"
  echo ""
  echo "To get started:"
  echo "1. Visit https://console.evermind.ai/ to get your API key"
  echo "2. Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):"
  echo "   export EVERMEM_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\""
  echo "3. Restart Claude Code"
else
  echo "STATUS: Configured"
  echo "API Key: ${EVERMEM_API_KEY:0:10}..."
fi
```

Present the configuration status to the user. If not configured, guide them through the setup steps.

**Available Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/evermem:help` | Show this help message |
| `/evermem:search <query>` | Search your memories for specific topics |
| `/evermem:hub` | Open the Memory Hub dashboard to visualize and explore memories |

**Automatic Features:**
- **Memory Recall**: When you submit a prompt, relevant memories are automatically retrieved and shown
- **Memory Save**: When Claude finishes responding, the conversation is automatically saved to EverMem Cloud

Share this information with the user in a clear, helpful format.
